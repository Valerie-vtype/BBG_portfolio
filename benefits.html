            <div><p>The way we assess incapacity (that is, assess if people should receive out-of-work benefits on the grounds of disability) is in chaos. This is partly because of a lack of clarity about exactly what we are trying to assess â€” the current system does not assess incapacity as most people would understand it.

            <div class="subsection-extra" id="stigma"><!--collapsing section-->
                <p>Is there a stigma to claiming benefits? If so, why, and does it matter? In a nutshell, these are the questions that I looked at in 2012 a collaborative project with Kate Bell and Declan Gaffney, funded by the charity <a href="http://www.elizabethfinncare.org.uk/">Elizabeth Finn Care</a>, who run the advice line / website <a href="http://www.turn2us.org.uk/">Turn2us</a>.</p>
                <p>The project isn&rsquo;t that big, but despite this we&rsquo;ve squeezed in a new survey, an unusually deep media analysis, analysis of existing data, and a few focus groups. An academic paper about the survey was published in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0047279415000525">Journal of Social Policy</a> (Baumberg <time time-date="2016">2016</time>).</p>
                <p>Aside from our one-page summary in the report itself, you can also read short blogs on several different bits of the report &mdash; we&rsquo;ve written on <a href="https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/perceived-fraud-in-the-benefits-system/"> perceived fraud in the benefits system (on Inequalities)</a>, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/business/economics/2012/11/scroungers-fraudsters-and-parasites-how-media-coverage-affects-our-view-benefit-cl"> the role of the media on the New Statesman blog</a>, and a longer version <a href="http://lartsocial.org/stigma">here</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2012/11/23/the-surprising-truth-about-benefits-stigma-in-britain/">how benefits stigma is misunderstood (on LSE Politics & Policy)</a>. Other people have written about the report in the Guardian (including on their Datablog), and the TUC&rsquo;s Touchstone blog (also reposted on Liberal Conspiracy).</p>
                <p>One part of this that some people seemed to have found useful is our &lsquo;mythbusting&rsquo; briefing (mainly a fantastic job by Declan), building on our earlier version for Red Pepper (version with footnotes). Note that I&rsquo;m currently reflecting on the idea of &lsquo;myths&rsquo;, so my views are developing in this area.

            <div><p class="item-type">Public attitudes to benefits and claimants</p></div>
            <div><p>There are several different areas of attitudes to benefits that I&rsquo;ve written about: Attitudes to disability benefit claimants; Trends over time; Tax avoidance and benefit manipulation; Benefits and the cost of living; &lsquo;Myths&rsquo; about the benefits system; Implications for policy.

                <h4>Attitudes to disability benefit claimants</h4>
                <p>Very little has previously been written on this, but my article (<time date-time="2021">2021</time>) in Journal of European Social Policy can be found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958928721996652">here</a></p>
                <h4>Trends over time</h4>
                <p>I was asked to write the chapters on benefits attitudes in the 2017 and 2014 British Social Attitudes reports, <a href="https://bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-34/tax-benefit-manipulation.aspx">Tax avoidance and benefit manipulation: Views on its morality and prevalence</a> and <a href="https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-31/benefits/introduction.aspx">Benefits and the cost of living: Pressures on the cost of living and attitudes to benefit claiming.</a></p>
                <h4>Whether we can say that people hold &lsquo;myths&rsquo; about the benefits system</h4>
                <p>There are three parts to this. Firstly, a paper looking at how far the public really do hold myths about the benefits system, published in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/spol.12347">Social Policy & Administration</a>. Secondly, a <a href="https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/the-social-legitimacy-of-targeted-welfare-9781785367205.html"> book chapter</a> looking at how far &lsquo;benefit myths&rsquo; are associated with more negative aspects of the benefits system. And third, I think about what this all means for policy in a paper in the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/175982716X14721954314968"><em>Journal of Poverty & Social Justice</em></a>. 
                <h4>What policymakers can do in a climate of negative public opinion</h4>
                <p>Aside from the final paper in the benefit myths project, I have an older paper in the <a href="https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/jpsj/20/2/article-p149.xml"><em>Journal of Poverty & Social Justice</em></a>.</p>  
                <h4>A variety of other blog posts</h4>
                <p>See my posts at the Inequalities blog under the keywords <a href="http://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/tag/public-opinion/">public opinion</a>, <a href="http://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/tag/political-attitudes/">political attitudes</a>, and <a href="http://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/tag/politics-of-inequality/"> the politics of inequality.</a></p>
