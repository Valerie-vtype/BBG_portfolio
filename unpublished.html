                <p class="intro-text">Inspired by <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2013/07/08/essay-importance-rejection-academic-careers">this wonderful blog post</a>, I think it&rsquo;s important to reveal the inevitable, yet still-painful failures involved in publishing academic papers. (Bearing in mind the <a href="critiques">critiques</a> of this kind of thing, I should make clear that I&rsquo;m not saying academic publication is a pure meritocracy that rewards effort &mdash; just that it inevitably involves failure!)</p>
                <p class="intro-text">In this section I list the rejections that occurred for the papers above before they were published, and (even more painfully), the papers that never made it... (These are available to anyone that wants them on request). This will doubtlessly seem strange to many people, but let me know if the post inspires you to do the same!</p>
