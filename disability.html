            <div><p>The way we assess incapacity (that is, assess if people should receive out-of-work benefits on the grounds of disability) is in chaos. This is partly because of a lack of clarity about exactly what we are trying to assess &mdash; the current system does not assess incapacity as most people would understand it.

                    <p>In a four-year ESRC-funded project 2014-17 (&lsquo;Rethinking Incapacity&rsquo;; ESRC grant ES/K009583/1), I therefore explored what inacpacity might mean, how other countries assess it, and conducted new (qualitative and quantitative) public opinion work to see what disabled people, policy elites and the British public think. I also looked at conditionality and sanctions for disabled people (spurred partly by how this was governed by the assessment process).</p>

            <div><p>In recent years I have been looking at the factors that affect the disability employment gap (the gap between the employment rates of disabled and non-disabled people), which triggered an interest in how you measure disability in the first place.

                        <li>There&rsquo;s also some more general things around the nature of work, including <a href="http://www.benbgeiger.co.uk/publications.htm#work_selfemployed"></a>Job Quality and the Self-employed: Is It Still Better to Work for Yourself?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This extends the earlier work in my PhD that was completed in December 2011, examined by Prof Francis Green and Prof Stephen Stansfeld, and supervised by Prof John Hills and Dr Tania Burchardt at the <a href="http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/case/">Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE)</a>. It&rsquo;s full title is: Does rising job strain explain deteriorating fitness-for-work and rising incapacity claims?</p>
                    <p>This resulted in three publications: a paper in the Social Policy and Administration (Baumberg, <time time-date="2014">2014</time>), a paper in Journal of Social Policy (Baumberg, <time time-date="2015">2015</time>) and a book chapter (Baumberg, <time time-date="2011">2011</time>).</p>
